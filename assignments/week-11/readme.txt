1. Create 4 boxes and center them on the screen both vertically and horizontally.
2. Add a circle in the top left corner of the first box.
3. Make the circle move around the perimeter of the containing square clockwise.
    a. Start at the top left corner.
    b. move to the top right corner
    c. move to the bottom right corner
    d. move to the bottom left corner
    e. move back to the top left corner
    f. repeat
4. Add a circle in the center of the second box.
5. Make the circle change to a white square, then rotate, then change back.
    a. Start with border radius 50% and red color
    b. change border radius to 0, color to white
    c. rotate 90deg
    d. change border radius back to 50% and color back to red
    e. repeat
6. Create two half circles in the third box.
    a. Start with two rectangles with height 2x width
    b. Set border-top-left-radius and border-bottom-left-radius to half the height of the left rectangle;
    c. Set border-bottom-right-radius and border-top-right-radius to the same value;
7. Make the circle to split
    a. move the left half of the circle with translateX(-100%)
    b. move the right half of the circle with translateX(100%)
    c. move both halves back to their original position with translateX(0) 
    c. repeat
